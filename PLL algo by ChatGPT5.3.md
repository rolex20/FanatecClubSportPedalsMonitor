- Act as an expert system engineer with deep expertise as a game developer in c, powershell and c#
- Help me plan the following task:  
- I need to integrate PedMon (main.c) and PedBridge.ps1 into only one new Powershell script named PedMon.ps1.  This way when I need to make changes in main.c I won't need to go to my developer laptop to recompile, then take the executable and test in my gaming pc and go back to the laptop to fix any issues.  With the new PedMon.ps1, I will be able to make changes to PedMon.ps1 and test them directly into my gaming PC.  I've tested PedMon main.c and PedBridge.ps1 and they are so fast that I am not concerned about delays, besides the deep interactions with the windows API for Joystick will need to be done from a helper c# class which is compiled so no worries there.\n- I also need *all* the message strings from PedMon (main.c) and PedBridge.ps1 to be at the top of the new PedMon.ps1 so I can easily modify them without the need for hunting them all over the code like a monkey.
- The same with configuration defaults, all at the top but after the strings.\n- Also, it won't be necesarry for the new PedMon.ps1 to use a shared memory to read the values from the Joystick.   New PedMon.ps1 will read the values from the joystick with a helper c# class and after that they can be made available to the http server by adding it to the list of frames handled by the current concurrent collection as it is doing now in PedBridge.ps1.\n- This means that the new PedMon.ps1 will need to leverage all possible benefits from a single integrated program instead of having two programs PedMon (main.c) and PedBridge.ps1\n- The new PedMon.ps1 needs to run perfectly on Powershell 5.1 on Windows 11\n- The new PedMon.ps1 will leverage all idiomatic benefits of powershell 5.1\n- The new PedMon.ps1 will minimize as much as possible the use of c# helper classes.  Only the bare minimun Win API calls and whatever else really must be on C#:  This way the user will be able to easily make changes and test them in the gaming PC.  The user is familiar with powershell but not with changing c# code.\n- The new PedMon.ps1 needs to handle the same command lines that PedMon (main.c) actually handles, except --tts and --no-tts.  The new PedMon.ps1 will always perform TTS on the same events that old PedMon (main.c) and PedBridge.ps1 actually do.
- The new PedMon.ps1 will always use asyn speak to avoid blocking (the same way it is doing now) 
- The new PedMon.ps1 needs to deliver exactly the same telemetry values via HTTP as PedBridge.ps1
- The new Pedmon.ps1 still needs several threads, one to read the telemetry at the specified interval and and accumulate the samples/frames in an efficient/concurrent collection/structure and at least another to do the web serving.
- Do not touch the current PedMon in (main.c ) or PedBridge.ps1
- Add any other recommendations you can think of.
